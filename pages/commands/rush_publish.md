Reads and processes package publishing change requests generated by "rush
change". This will perform a read-only operation by default, printing
operations executed to the console. To commit changes and publish packages,
you must use the --commit flag and/or the --publish flag.

Optional arguments:
  -h, --help            Show this help message and exit.
  -a, --apply           If this flag is specified, the change requests will
                        be applied to package.json files.
  -b BRANCH, --target-branch BRANCH
                        If this flag is specified, applied changes and
                        deleted change requests will becommitted and merged
                        into the target branch.
  -p, --publish         If this flag is specified, applied changes will be
                        published to npm.
  --add-commit-details  Adds commit author and hash to the changelog.json
                        files for each change.
  --regenerate-changelogs
                        Regenerates all changelog files based on the current
                        JSON content.
  -r REGISTRY, --registry REGISTRY
                        Publishes to a specified NPM registry. If this is
                        specified, it will prevent the current commit will
                        not be tagged.
  -n TOKEN, --npm-auth-token TOKEN
                        Provide the default scope NPM auth token to be passed
                        into npm publish for global package publishing.
  -t TAG, --tag TAG     The tag option to pass to npm publish. By default NPM
                        will publish using the 'latest' tag, even if the
                        package is older than the current latest, so in
                        publishing workflows for older releases, providing a
                        tag is important. When hotfix changes are made, this
                        parameter defaults to 'hotfix'.
  --pack                Packs projects into tarballs instead of publishing to
                        npm repository. It can only be used when
