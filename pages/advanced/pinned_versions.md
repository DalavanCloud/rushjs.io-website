# Background

Rush performs a single install for all your projects by creating a fake **rush-common** project in your common folder that references tarballs containing the dependencies for each project. For example, suppose your **rush.json** has two projects "**project1**" and "**project2**".  The generated file might look like this:

**common/temp/package.json**
```json
{
  "name": "rush-common",
  "description": "Temporary file generated by the Rush tool",
  "private": true,
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "@rush-temp/project1": "file:./projects/project-1.tgz",
    "@rush-temp/project2": "file:./projects/project-2.tgz",
  }
}
```

NPM considers each of these "**@rush-temp**" scoped projects to be a direct dependency for the **rush-common** project. In general NPM installs a project's direct dependencies first (at the root of the **node_modules** tree), and only then proceed to download the indirect dependencies.  But since your real project's direct dependencies are now indirect dependencies for the **rush-common** project, the `npm install` behavior could be different.

Suppose **project-1/package.json** looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "project-1",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "library-a": "1.0.1",
    "library-b": "1.1.3"
  }
}
```

And let's say **library-a** (from the internet) looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "library-a",
  "version": "1.0.1",
  "dependencies": {
    "library-b": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

If you ran a normal `npm install` in for **project-1**, you would expect to have a **node_modules** folder which looks like this, even if **library-b@1.4.4** exists in the NPM registry:

```
node_modules/
  library-a/ (1.0.1)
  library-b/ (1.1.3)
```

Even though **library-b@1.4.4** matches the `"^1.0.0"` SemVer pattern, NPM doesn't install it because 1.1.3 (installed by `project-1`) already satisfies it.

But the **common/temp/package.json** described above would not guarantee this. Instead, depending on the dependencies of **project-2**, you could end up with this:

```
node_modules/
  project-1/
    library-b/ (1.1.3)
  library-a/ (1.0.1)
  library-b/ (1.4.4)
```

... which is also a valid solution to the SemVer equation.  Similar problems can arise when using Rush with NPM's [peer dependencies](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/npm/peer-dependencies/).

# Pinned Versions

To control these effects Rush introduces a concept of "pinned versions", which are dependencies that get explicitly added to the top-level **common/temp/package.json**.

You can "pin" a version by adding it to the config file **pinned-versions.json**.  For example:

**common/config/rush/pinned-versions.json**
```json
{
  "css-loader": "1.2.3"
}
```

This will cause **css-loader** to be added to the **common/temp/package.json** from our above example, like this:

```json
{
  "name": "rush-common",
  "description": "Temporary file generated by the Rush tool",
  "private": true,
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "css-loader": "1.2.3",
    "@rush-temp/project1": "file:./projects/project-1.tgz",
    "@rush-temp/project2": "file:./projects/project-2.tgz",
  }
}
```

*Note: If you are publishing packages, you should be careful about pinning versions in a way that would produce a different result than a person who installs your library normally using NPM.*

# Implicitly Pinned Versions

In general, *you don't need to pin versions explicitly*.  In our original example, Rush would probably automatically solve the problem for you using "implicitly pinned versions".  Most likely your **common/temp/package.json** will already look like this:

```json
{
  "name": "rush-common",
  "description": "Temporary file generated by the Rush tool",
  "private": true,
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "library-a": "~1.0.0",
    "library-b": "1.1.3",
    "@rush-temp/project1": "file:./projects/project-1.tgz",
    "@rush-temp/project2": "file:./projects/project-2.tgz",
  }
}
```

As long as two projects don't request incompatible versions of a library, Rush will implicitly pin their versions.  But if **project1** and **project2** were requesting different versions of **library-b**, then you might need to get involved, and maybe use **pinned-versions.json** to resolve your issue.
